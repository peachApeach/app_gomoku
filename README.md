## Overview

Welcome to my development template for running a Python project as a web application. This template combines a Python backend with a Vue.js frontend, providing a solid foundation to kickstart your projects.

## Try the Project - WebApp

### 1. Install Docker

To run this project, the first step is to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your machine. Docker simplifies deployment by providing an isolated environment for your application.

### 2. Install Make (Optional)

This project includes a Makefile, which allows you to execute Docker commands more easily, without having to type them manually. While using `make` is optional, it is highly recommended to simplify operations. You can install `make` by following [this link](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download) or by searching for installation instructions specific to your system.

### 3. Run the WebApp

#### With Make

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
make
```
This will display:

Next, run this to start the web application:

```bash
make run
```
#### Without Make

If you prefer not to use `make`, you can start the web application by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
## Try the Project - Script Only

**Navigate to the Project Folder**

You can access the project folder by using [this link](https://github.com/DevJ2K/template_webapp/tree/main/backend/project_name).
